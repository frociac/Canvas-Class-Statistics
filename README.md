# Canvas Class Statistics

### Chrome Extension intended to show more grade statistics for on the canvas grades page. It calculates the upperquartile, mean, high, and median score and displays this at the bottom of the page. It does so by using the data on the grades page. It does not use the canvas api, thus, the grade info must be available for this to work
